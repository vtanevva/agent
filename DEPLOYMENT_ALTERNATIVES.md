# Alternative Deployment Options

Since Render deployment isn't working, here are several alternatives:

## 🚂 **Railway (Recommended)**

Railway is very similar to Render but often more reliable.

### Steps:
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile and deploy

### Files needed:
- `railway.json` ✅ (already created)
- `Dockerfile.railway` ✅ (already created)

## 🦊 **Heroku**

### Steps:
1. Install Heroku CLI: `npm install -g heroku`
2. Login: `heroku login`
3. Create app: `heroku create your-app-name`
4. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   heroku config:set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
   heroku config:set MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
   # Add other env vars as needed
   ```
5. Deploy: `git push heroku main`

### Files needed:
- `Procfile` ✅ (already created)
- `runtime.txt` ✅ (already created)

## ☁️ **DigitalOcean App Platform**

### Steps:
1. Go to [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps)
2. Create new app from GitHub
3. Select your repo
4. Choose Python environment
5. Set environment variables in the dashboard

## 🐳 **Local Docker + Cloud VM**

### Option A: DigitalOcean Droplet
1. Create a $5/month droplet
2. Install Docker: `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh`
3. Clone your repo
4. Run: `docker build -t chatbot .`
5. Run: `docker run -p 80:10000 chatbot`

### Option B: AWS EC2
1. Launch t2.micro instance (free tier)
2. Install Docker
3. Deploy same way as above

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### Port Issues:
- Make sure your app listens on `0.0.0.0:$PORT`
- Use environment variable `$PORT` (not hardcoded)

### Build Issues:
- Check if all dependencies are in `requirements-render.txt`
- Ensure Node.js version compatibility

### Environment Variables:
- Set all required API keys in deployment platform
- Don't commit sensitive data to repo

## 📋 **Quick Railway Test**

1. **Fork/Clone your repo**
2. **Push to Railway:**
   ```bash
   # Install Railway CLI
   npm i -g @railway/cli
   
   # Login
   railway login
   
   # Deploy
   railway up
   ```

3. **Set environment variables in Railway dashboard**

## 🎯 **Recommendation**

Start with **Railway** - it's the easiest alternative to Render and should work with minimal changes. If that fails, try **Heroku** or **DigitalOcean App Platform**.
